# Rivet Consolidated Pain-Driven Roadmap

This document is the **single source of truth** for Rivet planning. It consolidates:

- the current product direction and validated user pains
- the **numbered** strategic epics (§5, P0–P3)
- **execution status**: lettered epics (A–O, M), phase completion, task ✅/⏳, and Definition of Done (§9)
- packaging, security, trust, release, and external-adoption work that used to live in a separate roadmap

The purpose is to keep Rivet focused on recurring problems in database-first extraction while tracking what is shipped vs open.

---

# 0. Why Rivet exists

Most data teams that extract from PostgreSQL or MySQL end up writing a script. It starts simple — a `COPY` or `SELECT *` piped to a file — and then it grows:

- someone adds retry logic after a production incident
- someone adds batching because the table hit 50M rows
- someone adds a cursor column so the script does not re-read everything
- someone adds a memory guard after OOM on a wide table
- someone adds schema tracking after a column rename broke the warehouse

Within a year the script is 2,000 lines, understood by one person, and quietly critical to the business.

**Rivet replaces that script.**

It is a single binary that extracts data from relational databases into Parquet or CSV files — locally, to S3, or to GCS — with the safety mechanisms that production workloads eventually demand: preflight checks, tuning profiles, retry with error classification, incremental cursors, chunked parallelism, validation, reconciliation, and a crash-recovery model.

Rivet is deliberately **not** a CDC tool, not an ELT platform, and not a SaaS connector marketplace. It solves one problem well: **getting data out of a fragile database safely, predictably, and repeatedly.**

---

# 1. Product focus

Rivet should remain focused on:

**a source-aware, self-hosted extraction engine for fragile database-first systems**

Rivet is for teams that need to extract data from operational databases into analytics-friendly files/storage **safely, predictably, and with clear operational visibility**.

## Rivet is not currently optimizing to become:
- a Kafka replacement
- a CDC platform first
- an all-in-one ELT platform
- a SaaS connector marketplace
- a universal warehouse merge/load orchestrator
- a distributed execution platform

---

# 2. Validated pain themes

## Pain A — Fragile source databases
Repeated user pain:
- bad extraction queries can hurt production or replicas
- missing indexes make extraction dangerous
- parallelism can overload weak sources
- DB connection limits are often lower than requested parallelism
- billion-row tables require more careful strategies than generic JDBC partitioning

## Pain B — Weak incremental foundations
Repeated user pain:
- clean delta keys are often missing
- teams re-read large windows to avoid data loss
- late-arriving data forces replay/overlap strategies
- date-based slicing is often needed, but tools assume timestamp/unix-style partitioning
- sparse keys and weak partition columns make chunking unreliable or expensive

## Pain C — Poor visibility into change
Repeated user pain:
- schema drift is noticed too late
- widening text/string/json payloads break downstream assumptions without schema changes
- uniqueness/cardinality assumptions change and break downstream merge logic
- users want stronger visibility into what changed and when

## Pain D — Operational unpredictability
Repeated user pain:
- users do not know if extraction is safe until they run it
- users do not know if source-side migration/index changes are required
- users do not know what happened after interrupted runs
- users do not know what was exported, retried, or partially published

## Pain E — Self-built pipelines become hard to maintain
Repeated user pain:
- custom scripts grow into fragile systems
- behavior is understood by only one or two people
- guarantees are unclear
- retries, memory pressure, and late-data logic become messy over time

## Pain F — Connectivity and deployment friction
Repeated user pain:
- SSH / jump host / bastion access is common
- driver/URL handling is brittle and frustrating
- local SQLite state is not enough for stateless containerized deployments
- install/tryout friction matters for adoption

## Pain G — Event-driven alternatives exist, but are not the default reality
Observed market boundary:
- Kafka/CDC ecosystems solve a different class of problems
- many teams still live in a database-first world
- snapshot, replay, and backfill remain critical even where streaming exists

---

# 3. Roadmap principles

1. **Trust first, expansion second**  
   Before adding big new surface area, Rivet should become more trustworthy and explainable.

2. **Safety before throughput**  
   Parallelism and performance matter, but not before source safety and predictable behavior.

3. **One problem layer at a time**  
   Extraction trust layer first, then extraction intelligence, then adoption polish, then expansion.

4. **Solve recurring pains, not every theoretical use case**  
   New work should map back to validated user pain.

---

# 4. Priority tiers

Priority legend:
- **P0** = immediate / next milestone
- **P1** = strong next layer after P0
- **P2** = adoption/polish after core trust is solid
- **P3** = later expansion after the product is trusted

---

# 5. Consolidated roadmap

## P0 — Trust, Safety, and Explainability

These are the most validated and strategically important problems.

---

## Epic 1 — Preflight Planner & Source Safety
**Priority:** P0  
**Status:** ✅ DONE — lettered epic B; `rivet check` with strategy output, verdicts, sparse/dense warnings, connection limit warnings, profile recommendations  
**Pain coverage:** Pain A, Pain B, Pain D

### Goal
Turn Rivet into a tool that helps users understand whether extraction is safe before they run it.

### Deliverables
- stronger `rivet check`
- selected extraction strategy output
- tuning profile recommendation
- sparse range warnings
- connection pressure / parallelism warnings
- migration/index-required guidance
- degraded vs unsafe distinction
- initial recommended parallelism output

### Why this matters
Users repeatedly describe not wanting to find out too late that:
- a table needs an index
- a query will seq scan
- a chosen parallelism level is unrealistic
- source limits make the chosen settings invalid

---

## Epic 2 — Auditability, Manifest & Reconciliation
**Priority:** P0  
**Status:** ✅ DONE — lettered epics D, F; run summary, file manifest, `rivet metrics`, `rivet state files`, `--reconcile`  
**Pain coverage:** Pain C, Pain D, Pain E

### Goal
Make every export inspectable, attributable, and trustworthy.

### Deliverables
- run summary
- file manifest
- per-file row counts
- rows read / written / validated accounting
- reconciliation summary
- optional source-vs-output count checks for bounded modes

### Why this matters
After extract-to-bucket works, users immediately ask:
- what exactly was exported?
- which files belong to which run?
- how many rows were written?
- can I trust this result?

---

## Epic 3 — Recovery & Interrupted Run Semantics
**Priority:** P0  
**Status:** ✅ DONE — lettered epics C, H; crash matrix, lifecycle docs, E2E recovery paths, `tests/recovery.rs` (10 tests across 5 failure boundaries)  
**Pain coverage:** Pain D, Pain E

### Goal
Make restarts, partial runs, retries, and reruns predictable.

### Deliverables
- crash matrix
- chunk/file/run status model
- rerun semantics documentation
- failure injection tests
- recovery integration tests
- duplicate semantics documentation

### Why this matters
Without explicit recovery semantics, any interrupted run becomes:
- a debugging session
- a manual cleanup problem
- a trust issue

---

## Epic 4 — Durable State Backend
**Priority:** P0  
**Status:** ✅ DONE — `StateConn` enum supports SQLite and PostgreSQL backends; activated via `RIVET_STATE_URL=postgresql://...`; auto-migration on connect; `StateRef` for parallel chunk workers; documented in `docs/reference/cli.md`; `docker-compose.yaml` includes dedicated `postgres-state` service  
**Pain coverage:** Pain D, Pain F

### Goal
Support both local/dev workflows and durable production/container deployments.

### Deliverables
- state backend abstraction
- SQLite backend for local/dev
- PostgreSQL backend for durable/prod/k8s use
- init/migration command
- docs for deployment modes
- clear guidance: SQLite for local/dev, external backend for durable deployment

### Why this matters
SQLite is good for local and single-node workflows, but not enough for stateless workers in durable environments.

---

## P1 — Better Extraction Control and Change Visibility

These strengthen Rivet's core differentiation once the trust layer is solid.

---

## Epic 5 — Real Batch / Fetch / Write Control
**Priority:** P1  
**Status:** ✅ DONE — lettered epic M; `batch_size`, `batch_size_memory_mb`, `max_file_size`, `throttle_ms`, streaming uploads, per-export tuning overrides  
**Pain coverage:** Pain A, Pain B, Pain E

### Goal
Give users real control over how extraction interacts with:
- source load
- memory
- file generation
- runtime behavior

### Deliverables
- separate controls for:
  - logical chunk size
  - DB fetch size
  - writer flush size
  - parquet row group size
  - file rotation threshold
- docs explaining each
- planner hints for dangerous combinations

### Why this matters
Users repeatedly complain that existing tooling exposes “batch size” in unclear or misleading ways.

---

## Epic 6 — Date / Timestamp / Range Partition Intelligence
**Priority:** P1  
**Status:** ✅ DONE — `chunked` mode with `chunk_by_days`, date-native `>= / <` semantics, sparse range warnings, planner awareness  
**Pain coverage:** Pain A, Pain B, Pain D

### Goal
Improve support for large-table extraction by making partitioning more explicit and more realistic.

### Deliverables
- first-class support for date-based slicing
- timestamp-based slicing
- numeric range slicing
- explicit boundary semantics
- planner awareness of date-vs-timestamp tradeoffs
- docs/examples for large-table partition strategies

### Why this matters
Users repeatedly hit partitioning pain on 100M+ tables and often need date-based rather than unix-timestamp semantics.

---

## Epic 7 — Schema Drift Visibility & Policy
**Priority:** P1  
**Status:** ✅ DONE — column add/remove/type-change tracking in run summary + `on_schema_drift: warn|continue|fail` policy hook in YAML config  
**Pain coverage:** Pain C, Pain E

### Goal
Make structural source changes visible early and operationally understandable.

### Deliverables
- stronger schema drift warnings
- run summary schema flags
- documented behavior for add/remove/type-change
- future policy hooks: warn / fail / continue

### Why this matters
Users often discover schema drift only after downstream damage is already done.

---

## Epic 8 — Data Shape Drift Detection
**Priority:** P1  
**Status:** ✅ DONE — per-column max byte length tracked across runs; `shape_drift_warn_factor` YAML config; warns when growth exceeds threshold  
**Pain coverage:** Pain C

### Goal
Detect meaningful data-shape changes even when schema itself has not changed.

### Deliverables
- optional observed max-length tracking for text/string/json columns
- compare current run vs previous runs
- width-growth warnings
- docs for structural schema drift vs shape drift

### Why this matters
Widening text/string payloads are a real downstream failure source and are not captured by structural schema checks alone.

---

## Epic 9 — Data Contract Checks
**Priority:** P1  
**Status:** ✅ DONE — `quality:` YAML block; row count bounds, null ratio thresholds, uniqueness assertions; chunked aggregate quality gate  
**Pain coverage:** Pain C, Pain E

### Goal
Expose optional checks for downstream assumptions such as uniqueness and cardinality.

### Deliverables
- optional uniqueness probe for declared keys
- duplicate warnings
- docs for cost and usage
- foundation for future row-count bounds / anomaly checks

### Why this matters
A lot of downstream breakage comes not from extraction failure, but from drifting source assumptions.

---

## P2 — UX, Packaging, and Adoption Improvements

These matter for adoption and polish, but should not outrank trust/safety work.

---

## Epic 10 — Config & Connection UX Improvements
**Priority:** P2  
**Pain coverage:** Pain F

### Goal
Reduce friction around configuration and connectivity.

### Deliverables
- query vs table auto-detection
- better structured connection config
- explicit driver override
- clearer connection validation and errors
- better docs/examples for connection parameters

### Why this matters
These are real annoyances, but they are secondary to safety and trust.

---

## Epic 11 — Installation & Packaging
**Priority:** P2  
**Status:** ✅ DONE for current distribution baseline — GitHub release binaries, Docker GHCR image, Homebrew tap, crates.io package  
**Pain coverage:** Pain F

### Goal
Make trying and adopting Rivet easier.

### Deliverables
- ✅ GitHub release binaries
- ✅ Homebrew tap support
- ✅ Docker image
- ✅ crates.io package (`rivet-cli`)
- ✅ improved local quickstart and pilot docs

### Why this matters
Install friction is real, but only worth optimizing after product direction is clear.

---

## Epic 12 — Deployment Modes Guidance
**Priority:** P2  
**Status:** ✅ Partial — pilot guide, production checklist, Docker/Compose docs, and state backend guidance exist; k8s/Helm remains future  
**Pain coverage:** Pain F

### Goal
Help users choose the right deployment model.

### Deliverables
- docs for local/dev vs durable/prod modes
- Docker/Compose examples
- ⏳ k8s/Helm guidance
- state backend recommendations

### Why this matters
Many reliability problems come from running the tool in a mode that does not match the environment.

---

## P3 — Later Expansion

These are valuable, but should come only after the trust layer is mature and pilot feedback confirms demand.

---

## Epic 13 — SSH / Jump Host Access
**Priority:** P3  
**Pain coverage:** Pain F

### Goal
Support or document constrained connectivity environments.

### Deliverables
- documented external tunnel workflow first
- possible later native SSH tunnel support

### Why this matters
Real pain, but infrastructure/security complexity is non-trivial.

---

## Epic 14 — Narrow Warehouse Load Layer
**Priority:** P3 → **P1 (in progress)**  
**Status:** ✅ Partial — type system, type report, strict mode, BigQuery compat layer, complex types (M1–M6 complete); load path (Parquet → BQ) = future  
**Pain coverage:** Pain C, Pain E

### Goal
Add a narrow, compatibility-aware path from extracted files into selected warehouse targets.

### Deliverables
- ✅ canonical type system (`src/types/`: `RivetType`, `TypeMapping`, `TypeFidelity`)
- ✅ target schema adapters (`ExportTarget::BigQuery`, Arrow→BQ mapping with NUMERIC/BIGNUMERIC/REPEATED/etc.)
- ✅ compatibility report (`rivet check --type-report --target bigquery`)
- ✅ strict/permissive mapping policy (`TypePolicy`, `--strict` flag)
- ✅ column type overrides (`columns:` YAML block)
- ✅ complex types: Enum, Interval, List (Postgres); Enum/SET, TIME, arrays (MySQL)
- ⏳ direct load path (write Parquet files directly into BigQuery) = future

### Why this matters
Useful, but this opens a new product layer and should follow extraction trust.

---

## Epic 15 — WAL/Binlog CDC to Files
**Priority:** P3  
**Pain coverage:** Pain B, Pain G

### Goal
Extend Rivet from snapshot extraction into logical change extraction after the trust layer is mature.

### Deliverables
- logical change extraction
- insert/update/delete event model
- durable LSN/binlog position state
- changelog file format
- snapshot + changelog workflow

### Why this matters
A natural evolution, but only after auditability, recovery, and data quality are solid.

---

## Epic 16 — Automatic Parallelism
**Priority:** P3  
**Pain coverage:** Pain A, Pain D

### Goal
Move from warning-based guidance to controlled automatic parallelism selection.

### Deliverables
- recommended parallelism first
- later auto-selected parallelism bounded by safety rules

### Why this matters
Parallelism is valuable, but automation should come after better planner guidance and safety semantics.

## Epic 17 — MySQL Source Parity (COM_STMT_FETCH)
**Priority:** P1
**Pain coverage:** Pain A, Pain B

### Goal

Close the source-pressure gap between MySQL and PostgreSQL.

PostgreSQL issues a single `DECLARE cursor FOR SELECT …` and then repeats `FETCH N` — every round-trip returns a small batch, and the longest single SQL statement on a 2M-row wide table is **0.19s**.

MySQL uses chunked `SELECT … WHERE pk BETWEEN start AND end` queries, one per chunk.  The longest single statement on the same fixture is **~9s** — still 15–23× better than sling/dlt defaults, but far from PostgreSQL parity and potentially above a DBA's `max_execution_time`.

### Root cause

MySQL exposes server-side cursors via the binary protocol: `COM_STMT_EXECUTE` with flag `CURSOR_TYPE_READ_ONLY = 0x01`, followed by `COM_STMT_FETCH N`.  The `mysql` Rust crate v28 does not surface this flag in its public API — `exec_iter()` opens a fresh query per call with no persistent cursor.

### Deliverables (two-phase)

**Phase A — Adaptive time-feedback chunking** (1–2 weeks, no protocol changes)

- After each chunk, measure wall time.  If last chunk exceeded a configurable `chunk_max_statement_s` (default: 2s), halve `effective_bs` for the next chunk.
- Cap: do not shrink below `chunk_min_rows` (default: 1000) to avoid pathological overhead.
- Add `RIVET_MYSQL_CHUNK_TIME_FEEDBACK=1` env flag to enable the adaptive path explicitly during benchmarking.
- Expected result: longest single query on 2M-row table drops from ~9s to ~1–2s without protocol changes.
- Update benchmark tables in README to reflect new numbers once measured.

**Phase B — COM_STMT_FETCH server-side cursor** (4–8 weeks, protocol-level)

- Investigate `mysql` crate internals: determine whether `CURSOR_TYPE_READ_ONLY` can be set via an existing low-level API or requires a fork/PR.
- If crate supports it: implement a single-cursor extraction path for MySQL that mirrors the PostgreSQL `DECLARE … FETCH N` loop.  Path: prepare statement → execute with `CURSOR_TYPE_READ_ONLY` → `FETCH chunk_size` in a loop → `COM_STMT_CLOSE`.
- If crate does not support it: open upstream PR to `blackbeard/mysql_rust` exposing `CursorType` on `StatementParams`; track until merged; vendor if needed for near-term delivery.
- Known MySQL cursor limitations to test: `ORDER BY` in cursor context, temp-table creation on large result sets, `max_execution_time` interaction.
- Expected result: longest single query drops to sub-second on wide tables, matching PostgreSQL story.

### Definition of done

- [ ] Phase A: adaptive chunk feedback implemented and unit-tested; `chunk_max_statement_s` config field documented.
- [ ] Phase A: new benchmark numbers measured and README benchmark tables updated.
- [ ] Phase B: `mysql` crate cursor path investigated; upstream PR opened or workaround documented.
- [ ] Phase B: integration test covering the `FETCH N` loop against a live MySQL fixture.
- [ ] README note "MySQL parity roadmap" replaced with concrete timing numbers.

### Why this matters

The current README is honest about the 9s MySQL number, but it creates an asymmetric product story: "sub-second on Postgres, 9s on MySQL."  Many teams run MySQL exclusively.  Closing this gap removes the biggest technical objection for MySQL-first users and makes the benchmark headline symmetric.

# 5.1 Packaging, Trust, and External Adoption Track

This track replaces the former standalone `rivet_packaging_trust_roadmap.md`.
Its purpose is not to add extraction surface area; it makes the existing product
credible to a team evaluating Rivet without help from the author.

## Product trust message

Rivet should be positioned as:

> Safe, resumable, observable database extraction under failure and resource constraints.

Not as:

> PostgreSQL/MySQL to Parquet/CSV exporter.

The stronger message is backed by explicit docs and code paths: plan/apply,
preflight diagnostics, tuning profiles, state, journal, manifest, reconciliation,
recovery semantics, quality gates, resource controls, and reliability coverage.

## Completed trust hygiene

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Version consistency discipline | ✅ Active | release workflow, `rivet --version`, release tags, changelog/release docs |
| Security policy | ✅ Done | `SECURITY.md` documents access, artifacts, credentials, TLS, supply chain, reporting |
| Sensitive artifact hygiene | ✅ Done | README/security docs warn about `.rivet_state.db`, plans, journals, configs, outputs |
| README top positioning | ✅ Done | README leads with source-safe extraction, scope, non-goals, core promise |
| Fit / non-fit boundaries | ✅ Done | README and semantics explicitly exclude CDC, SaaS marketplace, k8s platform, loading |
| Execution semantics contract | ✅ Done | `docs/semantics.md` covers retry, crash, resume, repair, reconcile, non-guarantees |
| Reliability matrix | ✅ Done | `docs/reliability-matrix.md` separates PR CI, nightly, and manual coverage |
| Compatibility matrix | ✅ Done | `docs/reference/compatibility.md` covers PG 12-16 and MySQL 5.7/8.0 |
| Pilot kit | ✅ Done | `docs/pilot/README.md`, quickstarts, demo, walkthrough, production checklist |
| Benchmark methodology | ✅ Done | `docs/bench/` and best-practices methodology docs capture DB-side signals |

## Remaining trust work

| Work | Priority | Status | Definition of done |
|---|---|---|---|
| Release checksums (`SHA256SUMS`) | P1 | ⏳ Open | Every release publishes checksums and README verification instructions |
| Signed releases / attestations | P2 | ⏳ Open | Release artifacts can be cryptographically verified |
| SBOM | P2 | ⏳ Open | Release includes SBOM artifact and security docs mention it |
| 24h+ soak tests | P2 | ⏳ Open | Long-horizon extraction run documented in reliability matrix |
| Real-cloud destination release smoke | P2 | ⏳ Open | Manual release checklist records real S3/GCS smoke before publish |
| k8s/Helm deployment guidance | P3 | ⏳ Open | Docs explain supported pattern and non-goals without implying an operator |

## Demo/adoption priorities

The current GIFs and pilot docs cover the minimum adoption story:

1. `docs/gifs/basic.gif` — init, doctor, check, run, state.
2. `docs/gifs/plan-apply.gif` — sealed plan/apply with credential redaction.
3. `docs/gifs/reconcile-repair.gif` — chunked reconcile and targeted repair.
4. `docs/pilot/demo-quickstart.md` — scripted 14-table pilot fixture.

Next demos should focus on proof under pressure rather than happy-path export:

1. **Wide-table memory protection** — show RSS before/after batch caps and `work_mem`-aware FETCH sizing.
2. **Source-pressure run** — show export under concurrent OLTP writes with DB-side signals.
3. **Release verification** — once checksums/signing ship, document a clean install verification flow.

# 5.2 Production Feedback, v0.5 Stabilization, and Performance Track

This track consolidates the former `rivet_reddit_feedback_roadmap.md`,
`rivet_v0_5_stabilization_roadmap.md`, and `rivet_performance_roadmap.md`.
It keeps the production-viability feedback visible without fragmenting planning
across multiple roadmap files.

## Production feedback status

| Feedback item | Status | Current answer |
|---|---|---|
| pgBouncer / pooler safety | ✅ Done | Postgres transaction-pooler detection, `SET LOCAL` scoped inside guarded transactions, pgBouncer live tests, pool-safety coverage |
| MySQL pooler / multiplexer detection | ✅ Done | `MysqlProxyKind` (Direct, ProxySql, MaxScale, Multiplexed); 4-signal classifier (`PROXYSQL INTERNAL SESSION`, `@@version_comment`, `@@proxy_version`, `CONNECTION_ID()` drift) with 13 unit tests + ProxySQL live tests (`docker compose --profile pool up -d proxysql`) |
| MySQL live-test symmetry with PG | ✅ Done | 5 paired suites (`live_mysql_crash_recovery`, `live_mysql_chunked_recovery`, `live_mysql_resume`, `live_mysql_schema_drift`, `live_mysql_retry_and_faults`, `live_mysql_reconcile_repair`) — 29 MySQL tests mirror the PG matrix 1:1 for crash points / chunked recovery / resume / schema drift / retry+toxiproxy / reconcile+repair |
| Session-state cleanup | ✅ Done | Postgres RAII transaction guard; MySQL session variables reset on all paths; seed FK checks cleaned up |
| OLTP load tests | ✅ Done / ongoing | `live_oltp_load` plus `live_content_load` exercise concurrent writes, checkpoint pressure, MVCC snapshot behavior |
| Adaptive runtime feedback | ✅ Partial | `tuning.adaptive` reacts to Postgres `checkpoints_req` and MySQL `Innodb_log_waits`; still no `pg_stat_io` / tablespace-level controller |
| MCP operational visibility | ✅ Done | `rivet-mcp --stdio` (separate binary) exposes read-only Postgres, MySQL, and pgBouncer diagnostics |
| README/product boundaries | ✅ Done | README states no CDC, no SaaS marketplace, no k8s platform, no loading/transformation |

Open edge: feedback-loop guarantees are intentionally bounded. Rivet is still a
batch SELECT extractor with adaptive guardrails, not CDC, Arrow Flight SQL, or a
DB-resource governor.

## v0.5.x stabilization status

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Batch memory policies | ✅ Done | `max_batch_memory_mb` with `warn`, `fail`, `auto_shrink`; tests and best-practices docs |
| Row group tuning | ✅ Done | `parquet.row_group_strategy`, target/max row group settings, docs and golden tests |
| Compression profiles | ✅ Done | `none`, `fast`, `balanced`, `compact`; docs explain CPU/size trade-offs |
| Quality memory control | ✅ Partial | typed hashing and `unique_max_entries`; future: approximate distinct / default caps |
| Resume semantics | ✅ Done | stricter `--resume`, recovery docs, chunk checkpoint tests |
| Resource estimates | ✅ Partial | `rivet plan` shows advisory estimates; future: optional sampling (`plan --sample N`) |
| Benchmark evidence | ✅ Partial | `docs/bench/` cross-tool harness and DB-side signals; future: release-gated perf budget |

## Performance/resource-control status

| Area | Status | Current implementation / next step |
|---|---|---|
| Benchmark matrix | ✅ Partial | `docs/bench/harness/` captures wall/RSS/CPU/output and DB-side signals; keep manual before release |
| Adaptive batch by row width | ✅ Done | `batch_size_memory_mb`, first-batch observation, Postgres `work_mem` cap, MySQL row buffer cap |
| Hard Arrow batch cap | ✅ Done | actual Arrow buffer accounting via `get_array_memory_size()` |
| Quality unique hot path | ✅ Done | typed xxHash3-64 hashing; cap support remains opt-in |
| Compression presets | ✅ Done | profile-to-codec mapping shipped |
| Parquet row group tuning | ✅ Done | auto/fixed rows/fixed memory modes |
| PostgreSQL state optimization | ✅ Done | chunk task/state paths use structured stores and transactional writes |
| Direct multipart upload | ⏳ Future | optional complexity; current S3/GCS paths use streaming writes |

Near-term resource-control priorities:

1. Add optional `rivet plan --sample N` to replace purely heuristic memory estimates when users can afford a small source probe.
2. Add a warning when `quality.unique_columns` is configured without `unique_max_entries`.
3. Promote the DB-signal benchmark harness into the release checklist so source-friendliness regressions are visible before publishing.
4. Keep `pg_stat_io` / tablespace / IO-concurrency adaptation as future DBA-grade work, not a v0.x guarantee.

# 7. Strongest near-term niche

The best near-term niche remains:

**small-to-mid data teams extracting from PostgreSQL/MySQL and similar database-first operational sources into analytics-friendly files/storage, where current custom pipelines are painful and heavy ingestion platforms are not a good fit.**

---

# 8. Final summary

The strongest and most defensible direction for Rivet remains:

**safe, predictable, source-aware extraction from fragile database-first systems**

The roadmap should continue to optimize for:
- trust
- safety
- explainability
- auditability
- recovery
- drift visibility
- controllable performance

before broadening into:
- warehouse loading
- CDC
- broader platform ambitions

---

# 9. Execution status (lettered epics & phases)

## 9.2 Current state (0.6.0)

Rivet core is **feature-complete for stable extraction with type safety, resource controls, and external trust documentation**. All Wave 1–3 stabilisation epics are shipped; Epic 14 type safety layer (M1–M6) complete; observability layer includes persistent RunJournal; packaging/trust docs now cover security, semantics, reliability, compatibility, pilots, and benchmarks. 0.6.0 adds the `table:` config shortcut, MySQL chunking/memory parity with Postgres, `work_mem`-aware `FETCH` capping, ProxySQL / MaxScale detection, the first published cross-tool benchmark harness (defaults + steelman), and ships the MCP server as a separate `rivet-mcp` binary.

### Extraction

- PostgreSQL and MySQL streaming extraction
- Parquet and CSV (zstd default; snappy, gzip, lz4, none)
- Local, S3, GCS, **stdout** (streaming uploads)
- Modes: `full`, `incremental`, `chunked`, `time_window`
- `max_file_size`, `--param` / `${VAR}`, `skip_empty`, shell completions
- `batch_size_memory_mb`, **jemalloc** (default feature), misplaced `tuning` validation
- `rivet check`, `rivet doctor`, SQLite state + migrations, metrics, file manifest, chunk checkpoints
- Schema tracking, typed retries (SQLSTATE / MySQL codes), `--validate`, `--reconcile`
- Tuning profiles, Slack, data **quality** checks, meta columns
- Date-native chunking (`chunk_by_days`), connection limit warnings, `rivet init`
- **Plan/Apply workflow** — sealed execution artifacts (`rivet plan` / `rivet apply`, ADR-0005)
- **Parallel exports** — `--parallel-exports` (threads) and `--parallel-export-processes` (OS processes) with live cards UI

### Type safety (M1–M6, Epic 14)

- Canonical type system: `RivetType`, `TypeMapping`, `TypeFidelity`, `ColumnOverrides`
- `TypePolicy` with Fail/Warn/Allow per fidelity level; `--strict` CLI gate
- `rivet check --type-report [--json] [--target bigquery]`
- BigQuery compatibility layer: NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, TIMESTAMP, DATETIME, REPEATED, overflow warnings
- Per-column overrides: `columns: { col: decimal(p,s) }` inline string syntax; `rivet init` auto-generates from `information_schema` precision/scale
- Complex types: Enum, Interval→Utf8 ISO 8601 (Postgres), List/Array (Postgres), MySQL TIME/TIME2, MySQL ENUM/SET
- Unsupported-column errors now report **all** unmappable columns in one message (not just the first)
- **Golden E2E trust proof** — [`tests/live_type_golden.rs`](tests/live_type_golden.rs): Postgres *and* MySQL; DB → `rivet run` → Parquet → Arrow read-back; decimal sums, timestamp `tz=None` vs `UTC`, binary, UUID/VARCHAR text, INTERVAL ISO 8601 values. Dedicated `test-type-golden` CI gate (Postgres + MySQL only, faster than full `e2e` job).

### Observability

- `RunJournal` domain model: 13 `RunEvent` variants (plan snapshot, files, retries, chunks, quality issues, schema changes, outcome)
- **Persistent** — serialized to `run_journal` SQLite table (migration v7) at end of every run; `store_journal` / `load_journal` / `recent_journals` APIs
- **`rivet journal --config <file> --export <name>`** — inspect last N runs: per-run header (status, duration, run_id), files/rows/bytes summary, retries, quality issues, schema changes, error first line
- `--run-id <id>` flag to inspect a specific run
- **MCP server** — read-only DB introspection tools for Postgres/MySQL/pgBouncer (`pg_stat_activity`, checkpoint pressure, table stats, locks, `pg_stat_statements` IO, processlist, key metrics)

### Architecture (stabilisation plan — all complete)

- `ResolvedRunPlan` planning layer; `RawConfig` / `ValidatedConfig` separation (Epics 1, 3)
- Centralized `PlanValidator` with compatibility diagnostics (Epic 2)
- State update invariants + `tests/invariants.rs` (Epic 4, ADR-0001)
- CLI-product boundary locked, module visibility hardened (Epic 5, ADR-0002)
- Domain state stores: `CursorStore`, `ManifestStore`, `MetricsStore`, `SchemaHistoryStore`, `JournalStore` (Epics 6, 10)
- `ExtractionStrategy` explicit types; Planning / Execution / Persistence layers (Epics 7, 8, ADR-0003)
- `DestinationCapabilities`, `WriteCommitProtocol` per backend (Epic 9, ADR-0004)
- Semantic release gates — `test-invariants`, `test-recovery`, `test-compatibility`, **`test-type-golden`** required before build (Epics 11–14/arch)

### Release & distribution

- **CI:** rustfmt, clippy, tests, release build, **E2E** (Docker Compose), cargo audit, semantic gates + `test-type-golden`
- **Release:** Linux x86_64/arm64, macOS arm64/Intel binaries; Docker GHCR; Homebrew tap
- **Published:** `rivet-cli` on crates.io
- **Trust docs:** `SECURITY.md`, `docs/semantics.md`, `docs/reliability-matrix.md`, `docs/reference/compatibility.md`, `docs/pilot/`, `docs/bench/`
